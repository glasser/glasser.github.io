I used to run a [WordPress blog, hosted at DreamHost][archive], but I haven't
touched it in over five years.

Today, I noticed that it didn't seem to be responding any more. Oops.

Rather than fix it, I installed [jekyll] and moved the domain to GitHub
Pages. Took under an hour, and now I can update my blog with git.

I might try to import my old posts at some point, but don't hold your breath.
